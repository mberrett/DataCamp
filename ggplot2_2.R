# 1) base package and ggplot2, part 1 - plot

# Plot the correct variables of mtcars
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Change cyl inside mtcars to a factor
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Make the same plot as in the first instruction
plot(mtcars$wt,mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Recall that under-the-hood, factors are simply integer type vectors,
# so the colors in the second plot are 1, 2, and 3. 
# In the first plot the colors were 4, 6, and 8.
#================================================================================
# 2) base package and ggplot2, part 2 - lm

# Basic plot
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)

# Use lm() to calculate a linear model and save it as carModel
carModel <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

# Call abline() with carModel as first argument and set lty to 2
abline(carModel, lty = 2)

# Plot each subset efficiently with lapply
# You don't have to edit this code
lapply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, subset = (cyl == x)), col = x)
})

# This code will draw the legend of the plot
# You don't have to edit this code
legend(x = 5, y = 33, legend = levels(mtcars$cyl),
       col = 1:3, pch = 1, bty = "n")

#================================================================================
# base package and ggplot2, part 3

# Convert cyl to factor (don't need to change)
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)

# Example from base R (don't need to change)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)
abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars), lty = 2)
lapply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, subset = (cyl == x)), col = x)
})
legend(x = 5, y = 33, legend = levels(mtcars$cyl),
       col = 1:3, pch = 1, bty = "n")

# Plot 1: add geom_point() to this command to create a scatter plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point()  # Fill in using instructions Plot 1

# Plot 2: include the lines of the linear models, per cyl
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point() + # Copy from Plot 1
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F)  # Fill in using instructions Plot 2

# Plot 3: include a lm for the entire dataset in its whole
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point() + # Copy from Plot 2
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) + # Copy from Plot 2
